        <p>This video is made with a colleague and we had no difficulty in presenting it, before he helped me to
          introduce myself and prepare for an interview in English which helped me a lot for future personal
          resentaicones, with my partner we really helped each other a lot when it comes to present them. I also helped
          him with his interview. It is important to be clear in what we say and know and more so when it is in English.
