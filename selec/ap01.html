          everything started with seeing a video of him
          video of him and clearly the life that he tells and behind, inspires me to be able to achieve my goals.
          I also enrolled in a course of him and learned a lot, and in the area of English I learned to give a
          presentation of any person and even of oneself, as a
          person and even of oneself, what it is really like to be able to talk about someone, there is something that

          motivation and learning English is positive, and I received feedback on how I should pronounce texts and so
          on.
          texts and so on, and to improve words, pronunciation and vocabulary.</p>
